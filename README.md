This project was update to Nextjs 14.

# About this project
Change body's background color based on the size of a section and its position relative to the viewport.
I have used the Intersection Observer API to get the position of an element relative to the viewport. And the background color of the body changes due to element's position and the element's background color.

You can read more about this method in: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API
