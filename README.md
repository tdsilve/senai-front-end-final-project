## About this project

1. Change body's background color based on the size of a section and its position relative to the viewport.

I have used the Element.getBoundingClientRect() to get the position of an element relative to the viewport. And the background color of the bady changes due to element's position and the element's background color.

You can read more about this method in: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect

2. The website content is in a JSON file in 'src/Data'

3. I have used styled components.
